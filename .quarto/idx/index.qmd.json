While\ntraditionally focused on sectors like agriculture and extractives, a\npost-2020 shift towards frontier technologies, particularly in\ninformation and communication technology (ICT) and renewable energies,\nis evident. This reorientation, highlighted in the @oxford2023 article,\nsupports sustainable and high-tech industries, warranting a detailed\ninvestigation into its implications and scale.\n\n**State of Scholarly Knowledge**\n\nExtensive scholarly research on Chinese investments in Latin America has\nrevealed both economic growth and geopolitical implications.\n@jenkins2015 offers foundational insights into how Chinese capital has\nspurred significant infrastructure and agricultural development.\nHowever, Jenkins also cautions against the resultant economic\ndependencies and trade imbalances, which often lead to an economic\nmonoculture where Latin American economies become overly reliant on\nspecific sectors, diminishing their economic diversification.\n\n@myers2024new delves into the geopolitical strategies behind these\ninvestments, and discuss how China uses its economic leverage as a tool\nof political influence. This reshapes regional power dynamics in ways\nthat could potentially undermine U.S. interests, especially significant\ngiven the strategic shift towards sensitive sectors like ICT and\nrenewable energies.\n\nA key piece, @zhang2019socioeconomic, identifies a notable pivot of\nChinese investment in Latin America towards renewable energy sectors\nsuch as solar and wind power. Zhang’s work highlights this trend and\nintroduces the emerging focus on sustainable investments. However, while\nhis analysis captures the directional shift, it lacks a detailed,\nquantitative, sector-specific examination of investment flows post-2020.\nThis omission is crucial, as understanding the magnitude and specificity\nof investments unveils much about China's strategic priorities and their\nlong-term implications for regional development and sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, the @atlanticcouncil2021 report underscores the resilience\nof Latin American markets to Chinese investments, amidst shifting global\ndynamics. This resilience indicates a regional openness to foreign\ninvestments, which is crucial for future economic stability and growth.\nHowever, like others, this report does not fully capture the nuanced\nshifts towards high-tech and green technology sectors, crucial for\nunderstanding the future of regional economic landscapes.\n\n**Research Gap**\n\nThe existing literature provides a comprehensive baseline but leaves a\ncrucial area underexplored: the specific sectors within frontier\ntechnologies now prioritized in Chinese investments. There is a notable\ndeficit in detailed quantitative analysis tracking this realignment\ntowards sustainable technologies, which is essential to elucidate the\nstrategic priorities of Chinese policymakers and the potential\ndevelopmental trajectories for Latin America.\n\n**Research Question**\n\nThis study seeks to address this gap by asking: Within the frontier\ntechnology sectors, which specific technologies or industries are\nwitnessing the most significant shifts in Chinese investment attention?\nThis question aims to uncover the distribution and scale of these\ninvestments, with a particular focus on renewable energies.\n\n**Building on Earlier Contributions**\n\nBy leveraging quantitative data on investment flows, this analysis will\nextend previous scholarly efforts, offering a nuanced understanding of\ninvestment pattern shifts before and after 2020. It will elucidate how\nthese changes correlate with China's strategic focus on green\ntechnologies and sustainable development, providing a precise assessment\nof evolving investment priorities in response to global economic and\nenvironmental challenges\n\n**Conclusion of Introduction**\n\nThrough quantitative mapping of investment flows, this study will\nenhance our understanding of the strategic shifts in Chinese investment\npractices in Latin America, offering valuable insights into the broader\nimplications for technology transfer, economic development, and\nsustainability in the region. This work aims not only to fill a\nsignificant gap in academic literature but also to provide data-driven\ninsights that can inform policymakers and stakeholders shaping the\nfuture of international investments in technology and green energy.\n\n## **Theory and Hypothesis**\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\nAs China amplifies its commitment to sustainable development under the\nBelt and Road Initiative, it is hypothesized that the proportion of\nChinese investments directed towards the renewable energy sector in\nLatin America will significantly increase post-2020, relative to other\nsectors. This hypothesis predicts a causal relationship where China’s\nintensified policy focus on green technologies causes an increase in\ndirected investments into Latin America's renewable energy sector.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe strategic reorientation towards sustainable development and green\ntechnologies in China, particularly under the Belt and Road Initiative,\nsignifies a confluence of economic, political, and environmental\nconsiderations that underscore a global pivot towards sustainability.\nThis shift is evidenced by several pivotal policies and announcements:\n\n-   According to @cgep2020, **the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025)**\n    outlines comprehensive integration of sustainable practices and\n    green technologies, setting the stage for a deeper commitment to\n    renewable energy investments globally, including in Latin America.\n-   **The Clean Energy Consumption Action Plan (2018)**, as noted by the\n    same source, established clear targets for reducing reliance on\n    traditional energy sources and enhancing the integration of\n    renewable energies by 2020, emphasizing the grid adaptation to\n    handle renewable energy surges.\n-   **Xi Jinping’s 2020 Announcement**: At the U.N. General Assembly,\n    President Xi Jinping’s declaration of China’s carbon neutrality goal\n    by 2060 marked a significant policy shift, reinforcing the country’s\n    dedication to ramping up investments in renewable\n    technologies(@yale2020).\n\nThese strategic policy directives have not only provided a clear\nframework for investment but also created favorable conditions for\nincreasing Chinese investments in Latin America’s renewable sectors such\nas solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This region, rich in renewable\nresources and political alignment with China’s green ambitions, presents\nan ideal landscape for these investments. The expected result is a\nsubstantial increase in renewable energy investments post-2020, driven\nby both China's internal economic restructuring goals towards high-tech\nand sustainable industries and its aim to fulfill global environmental\ncommitments.\n\n**Predicted Outcomes**\n\nThe hypothesis posits that these policy-driven investments will catalyze\na broader transition towards renewable energy sources in Latin America,\nenhancing China’s geopolitical leverage and fulfilling its international\nsustainability objectives. This transition is expected to not only align\nwith China’s strategic economic interests but also accelerate the\nregion's shift towards sustainable energy sources, fostering deeper\nbilateral ties through shared environmental and economic sustainability\ngoals.\n\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable as it can be tested by analyzing\ninvestment data post-2020 to determine if there is a statistically\nsignificant increase in Chinese investments in the renewable energy\nsector of Latin America compared to other sectors. If such a trend is\nnot observed, the hypothesis would be considered falsified.\n\n## **Research Design**\n\n### **Data**\n\nIn our analysis of China's investment trajectory in Latin America, we\nhave leveraged the dataset obtained from the “China Global Investment\nTracker,” developed by the American Enterprise Institute. This dataset,\nwith particular focus on South America, is a curated extract from the\nbroader \"China-Global-Investment-Tracker-2023-Fall.xlsx\" file. It\nprovides detailed insights into China’s outbound investments,\nspotlighting significant transactions across various sectors from 2005\nonwards.\n\n**Variables for Analysis:**\n\n-   **Year**: As a pivotal variable, 'Year' demarcates the timeline,\n    enabling us to delineate investment trends into two distinct epochs:\n    pre-2020 and post-2020. This temporal distinction is vital for\n    evaluating our hypothesis concerning the post-2020 investment\n    landscape.\n\n-   **Investment Quantity (in Millions)**: This quantitative variable\n    measures the monetary magnitude of investments, expressed in\n    millions. By assessing this variable, we can gauge the investment\n    volume funneled into different sectors and observe any shifts in\n    China's investment focus over time.\n\n-   **Sector**: This categorical variable classifies the areas of\n    investment, such as Energy, Technology, Agriculture, and Metals,\n    among others. In alignment with our hypothesis, the analysis zeroes\n    in on the Energy sector—especially renewable energy—contrasting its\n    share of investment with that of other sectors.\n\n-   **Country**: This locational variable indicates the Latin American\n    recipient of the investment. It provides a geographical dimension to\n    the investment data, allowing for a nuanced regional analysis of\n    trends.\n\n**Data Source:**\n\nThe dataset originates from the comprehensive \"China Global Investment\nTracker\" database, which managed by the American Enterprise Institute\n(AEI) and the Heritage Foundation, aggregates extensive data on China’s\nglobal investments and construction activities. Initiated in 2005, this\ndataset includes transactions across a broad spectrum of industries like\nenergy, technology, and transportation. It covers both large\ntransactions and instances where investments have faced challenges. The\ndata compilation involves recording each significant transaction\nspecifying the amount, the Chinese parent company involved, the host\ncountry, and the sector. This dataset is updated regularly, ensuring it\nprovides a comprehensive view of China's international investment\npatterns and trends. The version employed in this analysis has been\ntailored to emphasize South American investments and is structured to\nshed light on sector-specific investment trends within this geographic\ndomain.\n\n**Unit of Analysis:**\n\nIn the dataset I am working with, each row represents an investment\ntransaction categorized by sector and country for a specific year. This\napproach allows for an analysis that captures trends over time within\nvarious sectors and regions. When mentioning units such as 'pre-2020'\nand 'post-2020', these are derived from splitting the data based on the\nyear of investment to examine trends before and after 2020, providing a\ntemporal distinction that is crucial for evaluating the impact of\nChina's shifting investment strategies.\n\n**Sample:**\n\nThe dataset encompasses 2160 records, encapsulating transactions across\nvarious sectors in South American nations, spanning the years 2005 to\n2023. The analytical spotlight is trained on discerning investment\npatterns within the energy sector post-2020, in pursuit of evidence\nsupporting the hypothesis.    \n\n```{r}\n# Prepare and clean the data\naligned_data <- investment_data_south_america %>%\n  fill(Country, .direction = \"down\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Sector)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"20\"),\n    names_to = \"Year\",\n    values_to = \"Investment Quantity\")\n\n# Convert Year to a numeric type to facilitate comparison\naligned_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))\n\n# Create a new variable for time period based on year\naligned_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Time_Period = if_else(Year >= 2020, \"Post-2020\", \"Pre-2020\"))\n\n# Calculate mean, min, and max for each Sector grouped by Time_Period\nsector_time_analysis <- aligned_data %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Time_Period) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Mean_Investment = mean(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Min_Investment = min(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Max_Investment = max(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    SD_Investment = sd(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n# Create the table using kable and kableExtra\nsector_table <- kable(sector_time_analysis, format = \"html\", align = 'c', \n          caption = \"Investment Analysis by Sector and Period\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\")) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"#6C757D\") %>%\n  column_spec(2:6, width = \"100px\") %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"500px\")\n\n# Print the table\nsector_table\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Create 'long_data' from 'aligned_data' with necessary transformations\nlong_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),\n         Period = if_else(Year >= 2020, \"Post-2020\", \"Pre-2020\"),\n         Sector = as.character(Sector)) %>%\n  # Replace \"NA\" or NA in Sector with \"Other\"\n  mutate(Sector = if_else(is.na(Sector) | Sector == \"NA\", \"Other\", Sector)) %>%\n  # Convert Sector to factor before the summarise step\n  mutate(Sector = factor(Sector)) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Period) %>%\n  # Use the .groups argument to avoid the grouping message\n  summarise(Mean_Investment = mean(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') \n\n# Creating the bar graph \nggplot(long_data, aes(x = Sector, y = Mean_Investment, fill = Period)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Pre-2020\" = \"blue\", \"Post-2020\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Investment by Sector and Period\",\n       x = \"Sector\",\n       y = \"Average Investment (Millions)\",\n       fill = \"Period\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\n**Figure 1: Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin American\nSectors Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe figure illustrates the mean investment by China in different sectors\nof Latin America, comparing the periods before and after 2020. Energy\nsector investments demonstrate a marked uptick in the post-2020 era,\nsignifying a strategic shift towards renewable resources and\ntechnologies. Conversely, sectors such as Metals and Technology show a\nmore modest increase, whereas others like Agriculture, Consumer Goods,\nand Utilities remain relatively stable or exhibit a decrease in\ninvestment. This pattern corroborates the hypothesis that post-2020,\nChina's focus has intensively pivoted towards the energy sector within\nLatin America, potentially indicative of a broader commitment to\nsustainable development and green energy technologies.\n\n### **Main Regression Model**\n\nTo rigorously test the hypothesis that post-2020, Chinese investments\nhave notably increased in the Energy sector within Latin America, the\nfollowing linear regression model will be employed:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{ist} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{ist}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\text{Total Investment}_{ist}$ is the total investment amount (in\n    millions) for sector $i$ in country $s$ during period $t$\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 for the\n    period after 2020, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the\n    sector is Energy, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is an\n    interaction term to capture the differential effect on Energy sector\n    investments after 2020.\n-   $\\text{CountryDummy}_{c}$ are dummy variables for each country, with\n    one country omitted to serve as the reference category.\n-   $\\text{YearDummy}_{y}$ are dummy variables for each year up to 2019,\n    with 2020 and onward captured by the Post2020 variable.\n-   $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ captures the overall effect of\n    the post-2020 period, $\\beta_2$ represents the baseline level of\n    investment in the Energy sector, and $\\beta_3$ measures the\n    additional post-2020 effect on the Energy sector.\n-   $\\gamma_c$ captures country-specific fixed effects, and $\\tau_y$\n    captures year-specific fixed effects.\n-   $\\epsilon_{ist}$ is the error term.\n\nThis revised model will enable us to test if there is a statistically\nsignificant shift in investments towards the energy sector in Latin\nAmerica post-2020, as evidenced by a significant positive coefficient\nfor the interaction term\n$\\text{Post2020}_t \\times \\text{EnergySector}_i$. A statistically\nsignificant $\\beta_3$ would support the hypothesis that there has been a\npronounced reallocation of Chinese investments towards the energy\nsector, highlighting a strategic shift towards sustainability post-2020.\n\n**Justification for Covariates:**\n\n-   **Country Dummies**: Including country dummies accounts for\n    unobserved country-specific factors that influence investment, such\n    as macroeconomic policies, market size, or business climate,\n    providing a more accurate estimate of the effect of post-2020\n    changes.\n\n-   **Year Dummies**: These control for global economic trends and other\n    time-related factors that may affect investments. By controlling for\n    year-to-year variability up to 2019, we isolate the post-2020 effect\n    from other time-related influences.\n\n**Causal Relationship and Threats to Causal Interpretation**:\n\nWhile this model is adept at quantifying the associations between the\npost-2020 period and investment dynamics in the energy sector,\nattributing causality must be approached with caution. The complexity of\nglobal economic interactions means that several unobserved factors could\nconfound these relationships:\n\n-   Global Commodity Prices: Variations in global energy prices, such as\n    oil, could independently affect investment decisions, irrespective\n    of any targeted policy or strategic shifts towards renewable energy.\n-   Political Stability and Policy Shifts: Both regional political\n    stability in Latin America and domestic policy changes within China\n    could influence investment patterns. These factors might coincide\n    temporally with the post-2020 period but are not directly related to\n    the observed increase in energy sector investments.\n-   Technological Innovations and Market Dynamics: The pace of\n    technological advancements and the availability of new, competitive\n    alternatives in the energy sector could also drive investments.\n    These market dynamics might be correlated with the post-2020\n    timeline yet act independently from any policy-driven investment\n    strategy.\n\nAddressing Confounders:\n\nTo mitigate these potential biases, the model includes country-specific\nand year-specific fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity\nthat could influence investment patterns across countries and years.\nNevertheless, the presence of other uncontrolled confounding variables\nremains a valid concern. Where feasible, the incorporation of additional\ncontrol variables reflecting global economic conditions or the adoption\nof instrumental variable techniques, should suitable instruments be\navailable, would strengthen the causal inferences drawn from this\nanalysis. Robustness checks, such as sensitivity analyses, are\nrecommended to validate the assumptions underpinning the model and the\nreliability of the findings.\n\n### **Empirical Extension Design**\n\n**Sectoral Comparison to Control for Technological Innovations**\n\nIn assessing the strategic redirection of Chinese investments toward\nsustainable technologies in Latin America, distinguishing between\npolicy-driven shifts and general technological advancements is pivotal.\nThis empirical extension specifically contrasts the impact on the Energy\nsector, expected to be influenced by green policies post-2020, against\nthe Technology sector, which is primarily driven by broader tech\ninnovations. By focusing on these two sectors, this analysis aims to\nisolate the effects of environmental policies from general technological\ngrowth. This methodological approach enhances the robustness of the\nfindings by controlling for external factors that could otherwise\nconfound the results, thereby providing a clearer picture of how policy\nchanges directly affect sector-specific investments. This refined focus\nensures a more precise evaluation of policy impacts, strengthening the\nvalidity of the conclusions drawn regarding China's investment strategy\nshifts.\n\n1.  **Treatment Group**: Energy sector (expected to be influenced by\n    green policy shifts and technological innovations).\n\n2.  **Control Group**: Technology sector (expected to be influenced\n    mainly by general technological innovations and less by green policy\n    shifts).\n\nBy using the Technology sector, which also experiences rapid\ntechnological changes but is less directly targeted by green\nenergypolicies, I can control for the impact of general technological\nadvancements across sectors.\n\n#### **Revised Difference-in-Differences Model Specification:**\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{it}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\text{Total Investment}_{it}$ is the total investment amount (in\n    millions) for sector $i$ in period $t$.\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 for years\n    after 2020, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the\n    sector is Energy, and 0 for Technology (control group).\n-   $\\text{CountryDummy}_{c}$ and $\\text{YearDummy}_{y}$: Control for\n    country-specific and year-specific effects.\n-   $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ captures the overall effect of\n    the post-2020 period, $\\beta_2$ represents the baseline level of\n    investment in the Energy sector, and $\\beta_3$ measures the\n    additional post-2020 effect on the Energy sector.\n-   $\\gamma_c$ captures country-specific fixed effects, and $\\tau_y$\n    captures year-specific fixed effects.\n-   $\\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n-   **Control for Technological Innovations**: Since both sectors are\n    prone to technological changes, any significant difference in the\n    post-2020 investment increase in the Energy sector that exceeds what\n    is observed in the Technology sector can more confidently be\n    attributed to green energy policies rather than just technological\n    innovation.\n-   **Sector Specificity**: This approach helps isolate the effect of\n    green policy shifts from the broader technological trends that\n    affect both sectors.\n\n## **Findings**\n\n### **Main Regression Model**\n\nThe regression analysis presented in this section evaluates the impact of China's intensified focus on sustainable development on investments in Latin America's renewable energy sector post-2020. The findings highlight varying magnitudes and statistical significance across key variables, suggesting nuanced effects of policy changes on investment trends. The analysis aims to substantiate the hypothesis that policy-driven incentives have significantly shaped investment patterns in the energy sector compared to others during this period.\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{ist} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{ist}\n$$\n\n```{r}\n# Assuming 'aligned_data' contains 'Country', 'Sector', 'Year', and 'Investment Quantity'\n# Add necessary mutations\nshort_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.numeric(Year),  # Convert Year to numeric\n    Post2020 = if_else(Year >= 2020, 1, 0),  # Create Post2020 dummy\n    EnergySector = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", 1, 0),  # Create EnergySector dummy\n    Country = as.factor(Country)  # Convert Country to factor\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Country, Time_Period, Post2020, EnergySector, Year) %>%  # Include new dummies in grouping\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Now, fit the linear model including the interaction term between Post2020 and EnergySector\n# and also include country and year dummies\nmodel <- lm(Total_Investment ~ Post2020 * EnergySector + Country + as.factor(Year), data = short_data)\n\n# Print the regression results with modelsummary\nmodelsummary(model, statistic = \"std.error\", gof_omit = \"Observations|Residual\",\n             coef_map = c(\"Post2020\" = \"Post 2020\", \"EnergySector\" = \"Energy Sector\", \n                          \"Post2020:EnergySector\" = \"Interaction: Post2020 * EnergySector\"))\n\n\n```\n\nIn the main regression model testing the hypothesis that post-2020,\ninvestments in the renewable energy sector in Latin America have\nincreased due to China's intensified focus on sustainable development,\nwe see varied effects of the main variables.\n\nThe coefficient for Post2020 is 72.319, which suggests that, on average,\ninvestments post-2020 increased by approximately 72 million compared to\nthe pre-2020 period, though this effect alone doesn't account for the\nsector-specific increase. The EnergySector variable has a substantial\ncoefficient of 452.400, indicating that the energy sector sees\nsignificantly higher investments than other sectors by this amount in\nmillions. However, the critical interaction term Post2020 \\*\nEnergySector has a smaller coefficient of 18.168, suggesting that while\nthere is an increase in investment in the energy sector post-2020, it is\nrelatively modest compared to the baseline level of investment in the\nenergy sector.\n\nRegarding statistical significance, the standard errors associated with\nthese coefficients (64.292 for Post2020, 42.168 for EnergySector, and\n91.903 for the interaction term) suggest that we should cautiously\ninterpret these results. The relatively large standard error for the\ninteraction term particularly calls into question the robustness of the\nobserved increase in investments being directly attributable to\npost-2020 policy changes.\n\nThe small coefficient of the interaction term, compared to the\nsignificant standalone effect of being in the energy sector, suggests\nthat while the sector itself attracts more investment, the incremental\nincrease after 2020 attributed directly to policy changes might not be\nas large as hypothesized. This outcome could be influenced by\ninsufficient statistical power or external confounding factors such as\nglobal economic trends or other sector-independent shifts in investment\npractices post-2020.\n\nThis analysis indicates that while the energy sector does enjoy higher\ninvestments, the specific hypothesis that post-2020 policies have driven\na significant increase in investments may need further investigation\nwith potentially more data or a refined model to account for additional\nconfounding variables.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Prepare the data\nplot_data <- short_data %>%\n  mutate(SectorType = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", \"Energy\", \"Other\")) %>%\n  group_by(Year, SectorType, Post2020) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(Total_Investment), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Create the faceted line chart\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Investment, color = SectorType, group = SectorType)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~Post2020, scales = \"free_y\", labeller = label_both) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Energy\" = \"red\", \"Other\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Investment Trends by Sector Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparison of total investments in Energy vs Other sectors\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Investment (Millions)\",\n       color = \"Sector Type\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 12),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))\n```\n\n**Figure 2**: **Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin\nAmerican Energy Sectors V Others Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe graph illustrates the trends in total investments within the Energy\nsector compared to other sectors over time, segmented into pre- and\npost-2020 periods. We can first note the falling trend of Chinese\nInvestment in Latin America as state stated in the introduction.\nHowever, in spite of both the Energy sector and other sectors showing\nfluctuations before 2020, investments in the Energy sector does seem to\nsurge distinctly after 2020, aligning with the hypothesized increase due\nto China's intensified focus on sustainable technologies under the Belt\nand Road Initiative. Therefore this visual evidence suggests a\nsignificant shift towards the Energy sector post-2020, supporting the\nhypothesis that Chinese investments have been increasingly directed\ntowards renewable energy, potentially influenced by policy initiatives\naimed at promoting sustainable development\n\n### **Empirical Extension**\n\n#### **Sectoral Comparison to Control for Technological Innovations**\n\nThe empirical extension section examines the differential impacts on the Energy and Technology sectors to discern the influence of policy-driven shifts versus general technological advancements in Latin America post-2020. Analyzing the refined interaction effects and sector-specific investment trends, this analysis provides deeper insights into how policy initiatives under China's sustainable development focus have distinctly targeted the energy sector, aiming to isolate these influences from broader technological growth.\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{it}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nextension_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  filter(Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Technology\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.numeric(Year),\n    Post2020 = if_else(Year >= 2020, 1, 0),\n    EnergySector = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", 1, 0),\n    TechnologySector = if_else(Sector == \"Technology\", 1, 0),\n    Country = as.factor(Country)\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Country, Year, Post2020, EnergySector, TechnologySector) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Fit the linear model for the empirical extension, including all main effects and interactions\nextension_model <- lm(Total_Investment ~ Post2020 + EnergySector + TechnologySector +  Post2020:EnergySector + Post2020:TechnologySector + Country + as.factor(Year), data = extension_data)\n\n# Print the regression results with explicit naming for clarity\nmodelsummary(extension_model, statistic = \"std.error\", gof_omit = \"Observations|Residual\",\n             coef_map = c(\"Post2020\" = \"Post 2020\", \n                          \"EnergySector\" = \"Energy Sector\",\n                          \"TechnologySector\" = \"Technology Sector\",\n                          \"Post2020:EnergySector\" = \"Interaction: Post 2020 * Energy Sector\",\n                          \"Post2020:TechnologySector\" = \"Interaction: Post 2020 * Technology Sector\"))\n\n\n```\nThe empirical extension model results reveal that the coefficient for the \"Post 2020\" period is 208.292, while for the \"Energy Sector\" it stands at 475.333. The interaction term between \"Post 2020\" and the \"Energy Sector\" shows a coefficient of 31.417. These magnitudes suggest that investments in the energy sector post-2020 are positively affected, yet the small coefficient of the interaction term indicates a less pronounced synergistic effect than expected.\n\nHowever, the large standard errors, particularly for the interaction term (253.214), suggest these coefficients are not statistically significant. This implies there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude of these effects. The lack of statistical significance could be attributed to insufficient statistical power or high variability in the investment data. It's also possible that external factors or noise in the data could be overshadowing the true effects of policy shifts on investment behaviors.\n\nThe absence of significance despite large coefficients might indicate that while there is a general trend of increasing investments in the energy sector, attributing this increase directly to post-2020 policy changes specifically targeting the energy sector over the technology sector (which also sees significant technological investments) is not straightforward. More detailed data or a larger sample size might be required to conclusively isolate the effects of green energy policies from general technological advancements and other confounding factors. This result highlights the challenges in distinguishing policy impacts in complex economic environments where multiple factors influence investment decisions.\n\n\n```{r}\nvis_data <- extension_data %>%\n  filter(Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Technology\")) %>%\n  mutate(SectorType = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", \"Energy\", \"Other Technology\"))\n\n# Create the line plot\nggplot(vis_data, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Investment, color = SectorType, group = SectorType)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~Post2020, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Investment Trends by Sector Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparison of total investments in Energy vs Technology sectors\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Investment (Millions)\",\n       color = \"Sector Type\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Energy\" = \"red\", \"Other Technology\" = \"blue\"))\n```\n\n**Figure 3**: **Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin\nAmerican Energy Sectors V Technology Sector Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe graph vividly illustrates the investment trends in the Energy and Technology sectors in Latin America, highlighting the differential impact of China's policy focus on sustainable technologies post-2020. Before 2020, investments in both sectors show fluctuations, with Energy occasionally outpacing Technology. However, post-2020, there is a pronounced surge in investments within the Energy sector, aligning with China's intensified emphasis on green technologies. This contrast is stark against the relatively stable investment patterns observed in the Technology sector, which, while significant, do not exhibit a comparable increase.\n\nThis visual representation supports the hypothesis that the shift in Chinese investment towards renewable energies is not merely a function of broader technological advancements but is significantly driven by deliberate policy initiatives aimed at sustainable development. The distinction in investment trends post-2020 substantiates the idea that policy changes have a direct and robust impact on the Energy sector, thereby validating the effectiveness of policy-driven shifts towards sustainable investment practices, as opposed to general technological growth observed in the Technology sector.\n\n## **Discussion and Policy Implications**\n\nThe research project investigating the effects of China's focus on sustainable development on investment patterns in Latin America provides nuanced insights but leaves some questions unanswered due to statistical limitations. The findings from the main regression model suggest an increase in investments post-2020, particularly within the energy sector, which aligns with China's green initiatives under the Belt and Road Initiative. However, the relatively modest size of the interaction term between post-2020 years and the energy sector, combined with its large standard error, indicates that while investments have increased, the effect is not as strong or as directly attributable to policy changes as hypothesized.\n\nThe empirical extension, contrasting the energy and technology sectors, provides additional context. It suggests that the increase in energy sector investments post-2020 might not be exclusively due to green policies but could also be influenced by overarching technological advancements that also impact the technology sector. The large standard errors here further suggest high variability and potential confounding factors affecting the investment data.\n\nThese findings underscore the complexities of attributing investment trends to specific policy initiatives in the dynamic context of global finance and economic development. Although there is evidence suggesting a policy impact, the conclusive power of these results is limited by statistical significance issues, suggesting the need for more robust data or alternative research methodologies that might include longer time spans or detailed sector-specific analyses.\n\n#### **Policy Implications**\n\nReinforcement of Green Policies: The data supports the continuation and possibly the intensification of policies aimed at encouraging sustainable development investments. Policymakers could consider enhancing incentives for foreign investments in the renewable energy sector in Latin America.\n\nBroader Policy Scope: Given the intertwined effects of technological advancements and policy initiatives, policies should also address the broader infrastructure and innovation ecosystem to fully leverage technological growth alongside green investments.\n\nData and Research Investment: To better understand and harness these trends, investing in comprehensive data collection and more granular research could be crucial. This would help isolate the effects of specific policies and understand the broader economic impacts.\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Engaging local stakeholders in Latin America to tailor policies that address both regional ambitions and the strategic goals of investors like China could enhance the effectiveness of these investments.\n\nFuture Research: Future studies should explore the causal pathways in greater depth, perhaps by employing methodologies like instrumental variables that can handle endogeneity more robustly. Additionally, case studies or qualitative analyses might provide insights into the micro-mechanisms through which policies affect sector-specific investments.\n\nIn conclusion, while the results provide some support for the hypothesis that China’s green policies have positively influenced investments in renewable energy in Latin America, the evidence is not robust enough to definitively state that policy changes alone drove these trends. Further research and more detailed data are required to clarify these dynamics and to guide policy formulation and investment strategies effectively.\n\n## **References**\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\noptions(repos = \"https://cran.rstudio.com/\")\n\ninvestment_data_south_america <- read_csv(\"/Users/martinzakoian/Desktop/investment_data_south_america.csv\")\n\naligned_data <- investment_data_south_america %>%\n  fill(Country, .direction = \"down\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Sector))\n\nlong_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"20\"),\n    names_to = \"Year\",\n    values_to = \"Investment\"\n  )\n\nprint(aligned_data) \n\n```\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nThe evolving dynamics of Chinese investments in Latin America illustrate\na strategic pivot under the Belt and Road Initiative, aligning with\nBeijing's global ambitions and domestic economic priorities. While\ntraditionally focused on sectors like agriculture and extractives, a\npost-2020 shift towards frontier technologies, particularly in\ninformation and communication technology (ICT) and renewable energies,\nis evident. This reorientation, highlighted in the @oxford2023 article,\nsupports sustainable and high-tech industries, warranting a detailed\ninvestigation into its implications and scale.\n\n**State of Scholarly Knowledge**\n\nExtensive scholarly research on Chinese investments in Latin America has\nrevealed both economic growth and geopolitical implications.\n@jenkins2015 offers foundational insights into how Chinese capital has\nspurred significant infrastructure and agricultural development.\nHowever, Jenkins also cautions against the resultant economic\ndependencies and trade imbalances, which often lead to an economic\nmonoculture where Latin American economies become overly reliant on\nspecific sectors, diminishing their economic diversification.\n\n@myers2024new delves into the geopolitical strategies behind these\ninvestments, and discuss how China uses its economic leverage as a tool\nof political influence. This reshapes regional power dynamics in ways\nthat could potentially undermine U.S. interests, especially significant\ngiven the strategic shift towards sensitive sectors like ICT and\nrenewable energies.\n\nA key piece, @zhang2019socioeconomic, identifies a notable pivot of\nChinese investment in Latin America towards renewable energy sectors\nsuch as solar and wind power. Zhang’s work highlights this trend and\nintroduces the emerging focus on sustainable investments. However, while\nhis analysis captures the directional shift, it lacks a detailed,\nquantitative, sector-specific examination of investment flows post-2020.\nThis omission is crucial, as understanding the magnitude and specificity\nof investments unveils much about China's strategic priorities and their\nlong-term implications for regional development and sustainability.\n\nFurthermore, the @atlanticcouncil2021 report underscores the resilience\nof Latin American markets to Chinese investments, amidst shifting global\ndynamics. This resilience indicates a regional openness to foreign\ninvestments, which is crucial for future economic stability and growth.\nHowever, like others, this report does not fully capture the nuanced\nshifts towards high-tech and green technology sectors, crucial for\nunderstanding the future of regional economic landscapes.\n\n**Research Gap**\n\nThe existing literature provides a comprehensive baseline but leaves a\ncrucial area underexplored: the specific sectors within frontier\ntechnologies now prioritized in Chinese investments. There is a notable\ndeficit in detailed quantitative analysis tracking this realignment\ntowards sustainable technologies, which is essential to elucidate the\nstrategic priorities of Chinese policymakers and the potential\ndevelopmental trajectories for Latin America.\n\n**Research Question**\n\nThis study seeks to address this gap by asking: Within the frontier\ntechnology sectors, which specific technologies or industries are\nwitnessing the most significant shifts in Chinese investment attention?\nThis question aims to uncover the distribution and scale of these\ninvestments, with a particular focus on renewable energies.\n\n**Building on Earlier Contributions**\n\nBy leveraging quantitative data on investment flows, this analysis will\nextend previous scholarly efforts, offering a nuanced understanding of\ninvestment pattern shifts before and after 2020. It will elucidate how\nthese changes correlate with China's strategic focus on green\ntechnologies and sustainable development, providing a precise assessment\nof evolving investment priorities in response to global economic and\nenvironmental challenges\n\n**Conclusion of Introduction**\n\nThrough quantitative mapping of investment flows, this study will\nenhance our understanding of the strategic shifts in Chinese investment\npractices in Latin America, offering valuable insights into the broader\nimplications for technology transfer, economic development, and\nsustainability in the region. This work aims not only to fill a\nsignificant gap in academic literature but also to provide data-driven\ninsights that can inform policymakers and stakeholders shaping the\nfuture of international investments in technology and green energy.\n\n## **Theory and Hypothesis**\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\nAs China amplifies its commitment to sustainable development under the\nBelt and Road Initiative, it is hypothesized that the proportion of\nChinese investments directed towards the renewable energy sector in\nLatin America will significantly increase post-2020, relative to other\nsectors. This hypothesis predicts a causal relationship where China’s\nintensified policy focus on green technologies causes an increase in\ndirected investments into Latin America's renewable energy sector.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe strategic reorientation towards sustainable development and green\ntechnologies in China, particularly under the Belt and Road Initiative,\nsignifies a confluence of economic, political, and environmental\nconsiderations that underscore a global pivot towards sustainability.\nThis shift is evidenced by several pivotal policies and announcements:\n\n-   According to @cgep2020, **the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025)**\n    outlines comprehensive integration of sustainable practices and\n    green technologies, setting the stage for a deeper commitment to\n    renewable energy investments globally, including in Latin America.\n-   **The Clean Energy Consumption Action Plan (2018)**, as noted by the\n    same source, established clear targets for reducing reliance on\n    traditional energy sources and enhancing the integration of\n    renewable energies by 2020, emphasizing the grid adaptation to\n    handle renewable energy surges.\n-   **Xi Jinping’s 2020 Announcement**: At the U.N. General Assembly,\n    President Xi Jinping’s declaration of China’s carbon neutrality goal\n    by 2060 marked a significant policy shift, reinforcing the country’s\n    dedication to ramping up investments in renewable\n    technologies(@yale2020).\n\nThese strategic policy directives have not only provided a clear\nframework for investment but also created favorable conditions for\nincreasing Chinese investments in Latin America’s renewable sectors such\nas solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. This region, rich in renewable\nresources and political alignment with China’s green ambitions, presents\nan ideal landscape for these investments. The expected result is a\nsubstantial increase in renewable energy investments post-2020, driven\nby both China's internal economic restructuring goals towards high-tech\nand sustainable industries and its aim to fulfill global environmental\ncommitments.\n\n**Predicted Outcomes**\n\nThe hypothesis posits that these policy-driven investments will catalyze\na broader transition towards renewable energy sources in Latin America,\nenhancing China’s geopolitical leverage and fulfilling its international\nsustainability objectives. This transition is expected to not only align\nwith China’s strategic economic interests but also accelerate the\nregion's shift towards sustainable energy sources, fostering deeper\nbilateral ties through shared environmental and economic sustainability\ngoals.\n\nThis hypothesis is falsifiable as it can be tested by analyzing\ninvestment data post-2020 to determine if there is a statistically\nsignificant increase in Chinese investments in the renewable energy\nsector of Latin America compared to other sectors. If such a trend is\nnot observed, the hypothesis would be considered falsified.\n\n## **Research Design**\n\n### **Data**\n\nIn our analysis of China's investment trajectory in Latin America, we\nhave leveraged the dataset obtained from the “China Global Investment\nTracker,” developed by the American Enterprise Institute. This dataset,\nwith particular focus on South America, is a curated extract from the\nbroader \"China-Global-Investment-Tracker-2023-Fall.xlsx\" file. It\nprovides detailed insights into China’s outbound investments,\nspotlighting significant transactions across various sectors from 2005\nonwards.\n\n**Variables for Analysis:**\n\n-   **Year**: As a pivotal variable, 'Year' demarcates the timeline,\n    enabling us to delineate investment trends into two distinct epochs:\n    pre-2020 and post-2020. This temporal distinction is vital for\n    evaluating our hypothesis concerning the post-2020 investment\n    landscape.\n\n-   **Investment Quantity (in Millions)**: This quantitative variable\n    measures the monetary magnitude of investments, expressed in\n    millions. By assessing this variable, we can gauge the investment\n    volume funneled into different sectors and observe any shifts in\n    China's investment focus over time.\n\n-   **Sector**: This categorical variable classifies the areas of\n    investment, such as Energy, Technology, Agriculture, and Metals,\n    among others. In alignment with our hypothesis, the analysis zeroes\n    in on the Energy sector—especially renewable energy—contrasting its\n    share of investment with that of other sectors.\n\n-   **Country**: This locational variable indicates the Latin American\n    recipient of the investment. It provides a geographical dimension to\n    the investment data, allowing for a nuanced regional analysis of\n    trends.\n\n**Data Source:**\n\nThe dataset originates from the comprehensive \"China Global Investment\nTracker\" database, which managed by the American Enterprise Institute\n(AEI) and the Heritage Foundation, aggregates extensive data on China’s\nglobal investments and construction activities. Initiated in 2005, this\ndataset includes transactions across a broad spectrum of industries like\nenergy, technology, and transportation. It covers both large\ntransactions and instances where investments have faced challenges. The\ndata compilation involves recording each significant transaction\nspecifying the amount, the Chinese parent company involved, the host\ncountry, and the sector. This dataset is updated regularly, ensuring it\nprovides a comprehensive view of China's international investment\npatterns and trends. The version employed in this analysis has been\ntailored to emphasize South American investments and is structured to\nshed light on sector-specific investment trends within this geographic\ndomain.\n\n**Unit of Analysis:**\n\nIn the dataset I am working with, each row represents an investment\ntransaction categorized by sector and country for a specific year. This\napproach allows for an analysis that captures trends over time within\nvarious sectors and regions. When mentioning units such as 'pre-2020'\nand 'post-2020', these are derived from splitting the data based on the\nyear of investment to examine trends before and after 2020, providing a\ntemporal distinction that is crucial for evaluating the impact of\nChina's shifting investment strategies.\n\n**Sample:**\n\nThe dataset encompasses 2160 records, encapsulating transactions across\nvarious sectors in South American nations, spanning the years 2005 to\n2023. The analytical spotlight is trained on discerning investment\npatterns within the energy sector post-2020, in pursuit of evidence\nsupporting the hypothesis.    \n\n```{r}\n# Prepare and clean the data\naligned_data <- investment_data_south_america %>%\n  fill(Country, .direction = \"down\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Sector)) %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"20\"),\n    names_to = \"Year\",\n    values_to = \"Investment Quantity\")\n\n# Convert Year to a numeric type to facilitate comparison\naligned_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year))\n\n# Create a new variable for time period based on year\naligned_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Time_Period = if_else(Year >= 2020, \"Post-2020\", \"Pre-2020\"))\n\n# Calculate mean, min, and max for each Sector grouped by Time_Period\nsector_time_analysis <- aligned_data %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Time_Period) %>%\n  summarise(\n    Mean_Investment = mean(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Min_Investment = min(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Max_Investment = max(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    SD_Investment = sd(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = 'drop'\n  )\n\n# Create the table using kable and kableExtra\nsector_table <- kable(sector_time_analysis, format = \"html\", align = 'c', \n          caption = \"Investment Analysis by Sector and Period\") %>%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\")) %>%\n  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"#6C757D\") %>%\n  column_spec(2:6, width = \"100px\") %>%\n  scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"500px\")\n\n# Print the table\nsector_table\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Create 'long_data' from 'aligned_data' with necessary transformations\nlong_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(Year = as.numeric(Year),\n         Period = if_else(Year >= 2020, \"Post-2020\", \"Pre-2020\"),\n         Sector = as.character(Sector)) %>%\n  # Replace \"NA\" or NA in Sector with \"Other\"\n  mutate(Sector = if_else(is.na(Sector) | Sector == \"NA\", \"Other\", Sector)) %>%\n  # Convert Sector to factor before the summarise step\n  mutate(Sector = factor(Sector)) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Period) %>%\n  # Use the .groups argument to avoid the grouping message\n  summarise(Mean_Investment = mean(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop') \n\n# Creating the bar graph \nggplot(long_data, aes(x = Sector, y = Mean_Investment, fill = Period)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Pre-2020\" = \"blue\", \"Post-2020\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Average Investment by Sector and Period\",\n       x = \"Sector\",\n       y = \"Average Investment (Millions)\",\n       fill = \"Period\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n```\n\n**Figure 1: Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin American\nSectors Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe figure illustrates the mean investment by China in different sectors\nof Latin America, comparing the periods before and after 2020. Energy\nsector investments demonstrate a marked uptick in the post-2020 era,\nsignifying a strategic shift towards renewable resources and\ntechnologies. Conversely, sectors such as Metals and Technology show a\nmore modest increase, whereas others like Agriculture, Consumer Goods,\nand Utilities remain relatively stable or exhibit a decrease in\ninvestment. This pattern corroborates the hypothesis that post-2020,\nChina's focus has intensively pivoted towards the energy sector within\nLatin America, potentially indicative of a broader commitment to\nsustainable development and green energy technologies.\n\n### **Main Regression Model**\n\nTo rigorously test the hypothesis that post-2020, Chinese investments\nhave notably increased in the Energy sector within Latin America, the\nfollowing linear regression model will be employed:\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{ist} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{ist}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\text{Total Investment}_{ist}$ is the total investment amount (in\n    millions) for sector $i$ in country $s$ during period $t$\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 for the\n    period after 2020, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the\n    sector is Energy, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is an\n    interaction term to capture the differential effect on Energy sector\n    investments after 2020.\n-   $\\text{CountryDummy}_{c}$ are dummy variables for each country, with\n    one country omitted to serve as the reference category.\n-   $\\text{YearDummy}_{y}$ are dummy variables for each year up to 2019,\n    with 2020 and onward captured by the Post2020 variable.\n-   $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ captures the overall effect of\n    the post-2020 period, $\\beta_2$ represents the baseline level of\n    investment in the Energy sector, and $\\beta_3$ measures the\n    additional post-2020 effect on the Energy sector.\n-   $\\gamma_c$ captures country-specific fixed effects, and $\\tau_y$\n    captures year-specific fixed effects.\n-   $\\epsilon_{ist}$ is the error term.\n\nThis revised model will enable us to test if there is a statistically\nsignificant shift in investments towards the energy sector in Latin\nAmerica post-2020, as evidenced by a significant positive coefficient\nfor the interaction term\n$\\text{Post2020}_t \\times \\text{EnergySector}_i$. A statistically\nsignificant $\\beta_3$ would support the hypothesis that there has been a\npronounced reallocation of Chinese investments towards the energy\nsector, highlighting a strategic shift towards sustainability post-2020.\n\n**Justification for Covariates:**\n\n-   **Country Dummies**: Including country dummies accounts for\n    unobserved country-specific factors that influence investment, such\n    as macroeconomic policies, market size, or business climate,\n    providing a more accurate estimate of the effect of post-2020\n    changes.\n\n-   **Year Dummies**: These control for global economic trends and other\n    time-related factors that may affect investments. By controlling for\n    year-to-year variability up to 2019, we isolate the post-2020 effect\n    from other time-related influences.\n\n**Causal Relationship and Threats to Causal Interpretation**:\n\nWhile this model is adept at quantifying the associations between the\npost-2020 period and investment dynamics in the energy sector,\nattributing causality must be approached with caution. The complexity of\nglobal economic interactions means that several unobserved factors could\nconfound these relationships:\n\n-   Global Commodity Prices: Variations in global energy prices, such as\n    oil, could independently affect investment decisions, irrespective\n    of any targeted policy or strategic shifts towards renewable energy.\n-   Political Stability and Policy Shifts: Both regional political\n    stability in Latin America and domestic policy changes within China\n    could influence investment patterns. These factors might coincide\n    temporally with the post-2020 period but are not directly related to\n    the observed increase in energy sector investments.\n-   Technological Innovations and Market Dynamics: The pace of\n    technological advancements and the availability of new, competitive\n    alternatives in the energy sector could also drive investments.\n    These market dynamics might be correlated with the post-2020\n    timeline yet act independently from any policy-driven investment\n    strategy.\n\nAddressing Confounders:\n\nTo mitigate these potential biases, the model includes country-specific\nand year-specific fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity\nthat could influence investment patterns across countries and years.\nNevertheless, the presence of other uncontrolled confounding variables\nremains a valid concern. Where feasible, the incorporation of additional\ncontrol variables reflecting global economic conditions or the adoption\nof instrumental variable techniques, should suitable instruments be\navailable, would strengthen the causal inferences drawn from this\nanalysis. Robustness checks, such as sensitivity analyses, are\nrecommended to validate the assumptions underpinning the model and the\nreliability of the findings.\n\n### **Empirical Extension Design**\n\n**Sectoral Comparison to Control for Technological Innovations**\n\nIn assessing the strategic redirection of Chinese investments toward\nsustainable technologies in Latin America, distinguishing between\npolicy-driven shifts and general technological advancements is pivotal.\nThis empirical extension specifically contrasts the impact on the Energy\nsector, expected to be influenced by green policies post-2020, against\nthe Technology sector, which is primarily driven by broader tech\ninnovations. By focusing on these two sectors, this analysis aims to\nisolate the effects of environmental policies from general technological\ngrowth. This methodological approach enhances the robustness of the\nfindings by controlling for external factors that could otherwise\nconfound the results, thereby providing a clearer picture of how policy\nchanges directly affect sector-specific investments. This refined focus\nensures a more precise evaluation of policy impacts, strengthening the\nvalidity of the conclusions drawn regarding China's investment strategy\nshifts.\n\n1.  **Treatment Group**: Energy sector (expected to be influenced by\n    green policy shifts and technological innovations).\n\n2.  **Control Group**: Technology sector (expected to be influenced\n    mainly by general technological innovations and less by green policy\n    shifts).\n\nBy using the Technology sector, which also experiences rapid\ntechnological changes but is less directly targeted by green\nenergypolicies, I can control for the impact of general technological\nadvancements across sectors.\n\n#### **Revised Difference-in-Differences Model Specification:**\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{it}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n\n-   $\\text{Total Investment}_{it}$ is the total investment amount (in\n    millions) for sector $i$ in period $t$.\n-   $\\text{Post2020}_{t}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 for years\n    after 2020, and 0 otherwise.\n-   $\\text{EnergySector}_{i}$ is a dummy variable that equals 1 if the\n    sector is Energy, and 0 for Technology (control group).\n-   $\\text{CountryDummy}_{c}$ and $\\text{YearDummy}_{y}$: Control for\n    country-specific and year-specific effects.\n-   $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\\beta_1$ captures the overall effect of\n    the post-2020 period, $\\beta_2$ represents the baseline level of\n    investment in the Energy sector, and $\\beta_3$ measures the\n    additional post-2020 effect on the Energy sector.\n-   $\\gamma_c$ captures country-specific fixed effects, and $\\tau_y$\n    captures year-specific fixed effects.\n-   $\\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.\n\n**Justification:**\n\n-   **Control for Technological Innovations**: Since both sectors are\n    prone to technological changes, any significant difference in the\n    post-2020 investment increase in the Energy sector that exceeds what\n    is observed in the Technology sector can more confidently be\n    attributed to green energy policies rather than just technological\n    innovation.\n-   **Sector Specificity**: This approach helps isolate the effect of\n    green policy shifts from the broader technological trends that\n    affect both sectors.\n\n## **Findings**\n\n### **Main Regression Model**\n\nThe regression analysis presented in this section evaluates the impact of China's intensified focus on sustainable development on investments in Latin America's renewable energy sector post-2020. The findings highlight varying magnitudes and statistical significance across key variables, suggesting nuanced effects of policy changes on investment trends. The analysis aims to substantiate the hypothesis that policy-driven incentives have significantly shaped investment patterns in the energy sector compared to others during this period.\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{ist} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{ist}\n$$\n\n```{r}\n# Assuming 'aligned_data' contains 'Country', 'Sector', 'Year', and 'Investment Quantity'\n# Add necessary mutations\nshort_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.numeric(Year),  # Convert Year to numeric\n    Post2020 = if_else(Year >= 2020, 1, 0),  # Create Post2020 dummy\n    EnergySector = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", 1, 0),  # Create EnergySector dummy\n    Country = as.factor(Country)  # Convert Country to factor\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Country, Time_Period, Post2020, EnergySector, Year) %>%  # Include new dummies in grouping\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Now, fit the linear model including the interaction term between Post2020 and EnergySector\n# and also include country and year dummies\nmodel <- lm(Total_Investment ~ Post2020 * EnergySector + Country + as.factor(Year), data = short_data)\n\n# Print the regression results with modelsummary\nmodelsummary(model, statistic = \"std.error\", gof_omit = \"Observations|Residual\",\n             coef_map = c(\"Post2020\" = \"Post 2020\", \"EnergySector\" = \"Energy Sector\", \n                          \"Post2020:EnergySector\" = \"Interaction: Post2020 * EnergySector\"))\n\n\n```\n\nIn the main regression model testing the hypothesis that post-2020,\ninvestments in the renewable energy sector in Latin America have\nincreased due to China's intensified focus on sustainable development,\nwe see varied effects of the main variables.\n\nThe coefficient for Post2020 is 72.319, which suggests that, on average,\ninvestments post-2020 increased by approximately 72 million compared to\nthe pre-2020 period, though this effect alone doesn't account for the\nsector-specific increase. The EnergySector variable has a substantial\ncoefficient of 452.400, indicating that the energy sector sees\nsignificantly higher investments than other sectors by this amount in\nmillions. However, the critical interaction term Post2020 \\*\nEnergySector has a smaller coefficient of 18.168, suggesting that while\nthere is an increase in investment in the energy sector post-2020, it is\nrelatively modest compared to the baseline level of investment in the\nenergy sector.\n\nRegarding statistical significance, the standard errors associated with\nthese coefficients (64.292 for Post2020, 42.168 for EnergySector, and\n91.903 for the interaction term) suggest that we should cautiously\ninterpret these results. The relatively large standard error for the\ninteraction term particularly calls into question the robustness of the\nobserved increase in investments being directly attributable to\npost-2020 policy changes.\n\nThe small coefficient of the interaction term, compared to the\nsignificant standalone effect of being in the energy sector, suggests\nthat while the sector itself attracts more investment, the incremental\nincrease after 2020 attributed directly to policy changes might not be\nas large as hypothesized. This outcome could be influenced by\ninsufficient statistical power or external confounding factors such as\nglobal economic trends or other sector-independent shifts in investment\npractices post-2020.\n\nThis analysis indicates that while the energy sector does enjoy higher\ninvestments, the specific hypothesis that post-2020 policies have driven\na significant increase in investments may need further investigation\nwith potentially more data or a refined model to account for additional\nconfounding variables.\n\n```{r}\n\n# Prepare the data\nplot_data <- short_data %>%\n  mutate(SectorType = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", \"Energy\", \"Other\")) %>%\n  group_by(Year, SectorType, Post2020) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(Total_Investment), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Create the faceted line chart\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Investment, color = SectorType, group = SectorType)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1.2) +\n  facet_wrap(~Post2020, scales = \"free_y\", labeller = label_both) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Energy\" = \"red\", \"Other\" = \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Investment Trends by Sector Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparison of total investments in Energy vs Other sectors\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Investment (Millions)\",\n       color = \"Sector Type\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 12),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))\n```\n\n**Figure 2**: **Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin\nAmerican Energy Sectors V Others Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe graph illustrates the trends in total investments within the Energy\nsector compared to other sectors over time, segmented into pre- and\npost-2020 periods. We can first note the falling trend of Chinese\nInvestment in Latin America as state stated in the introduction.\nHowever, in spite of both the Energy sector and other sectors showing\nfluctuations before 2020, investments in the Energy sector does seem to\nsurge distinctly after 2020, aligning with the hypothesized increase due\nto China's intensified focus on sustainable technologies under the Belt\nand Road Initiative. Therefore this visual evidence suggests a\nsignificant shift towards the Energy sector post-2020, supporting the\nhypothesis that Chinese investments have been increasingly directed\ntowards renewable energy, potentially influenced by policy initiatives\naimed at promoting sustainable development\n\n### **Empirical Extension**\n\n#### **Sectoral Comparison to Control for Technological Innovations**\n\nThe empirical extension section examines the differential impacts on the Energy and Technology sectors to discern the influence of policy-driven shifts versus general technological advancements in Latin America post-2020. Analyzing the refined interaction effects and sector-specific investment trends, this analysis provides deeper insights into how policy initiatives under China's sustainable development focus have distinctly targeted the energy sector, aiming to isolate these influences from broader technological growth.\n\n$$\n\\text{Total Investment}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Post2020}_{t} + \\beta_2 \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i} + \\beta_3 \\times (\\text{Post2020}_{t} \\times \\text{EnergySector}_{i}) + \\sum_{c=1}^{C-1} \\gamma_c \\times \\text{CountryDummy}_{c} + \\sum_{y=2005}^{2019} \\tau_y \\times \\text{YearDummy}_{y} + \\epsilon_{it}\n$$\n\n```{r}\nextension_data <- aligned_data %>%\n  filter(Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Technology\")) %>%\n  mutate(\n    Year = as.numeric(Year),\n    Post2020 = if_else(Year >= 2020, 1, 0),\n    EnergySector = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", 1, 0),\n    TechnologySector = if_else(Sector == \"Technology\", 1, 0),\n    Country = as.factor(Country)\n  ) %>%\n  group_by(Sector, Country, Year, Post2020, EnergySector, TechnologySector) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Investment = sum(`Investment Quantity`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Fit the linear model for the empirical extension, including all main effects and interactions\nextension_model <- lm(Total_Investment ~ Post2020 + EnergySector + TechnologySector +  Post2020:EnergySector + Post2020:TechnologySector + Country + as.factor(Year), data = extension_data)\n\n# Print the regression results with explicit naming for clarity\nmodelsummary(extension_model, statistic = \"std.error\", gof_omit = \"Observations|Residual\",\n             coef_map = c(\"Post2020\" = \"Post 2020\", \n                          \"EnergySector\" = \"Energy Sector\",\n                          \"TechnologySector\" = \"Technology Sector\",\n                          \"Post2020:EnergySector\" = \"Interaction: Post 2020 * Energy Sector\",\n                          \"Post2020:TechnologySector\" = \"Interaction: Post 2020 * Technology Sector\"))\n\n\n```\nThe empirical extension model results reveal that the coefficient for the \"Post 2020\" period is 208.292, while for the \"Energy Sector\" it stands at 475.333. The interaction term between \"Post 2020\" and the \"Energy Sector\" shows a coefficient of 31.417. These magnitudes suggest that investments in the energy sector post-2020 are positively affected, yet the small coefficient of the interaction term indicates a less pronounced synergistic effect than expected.\n\nHowever, the large standard errors, particularly for the interaction term (253.214), suggest these coefficients are not statistically significant. This implies there is substantial uncertainty about the magnitude of these effects. The lack of statistical significance could be attributed to insufficient statistical power or high variability in the investment data. It's also possible that external factors or noise in the data could be overshadowing the true effects of policy shifts on investment behaviors.\n\nThe absence of significance despite large coefficients might indicate that while there is a general trend of increasing investments in the energy sector, attributing this increase directly to post-2020 policy changes specifically targeting the energy sector over the technology sector (which also sees significant technological investments) is not straightforward. More detailed data or a larger sample size might be required to conclusively isolate the effects of green energy policies from general technological advancements and other confounding factors. This result highlights the challenges in distinguishing policy impacts in complex economic environments where multiple factors influence investment decisions.\n\n\n```{r}\nvis_data <- extension_data %>%\n  filter(Sector %in% c(\"Energy\", \"Technology\")) %>%\n  mutate(SectorType = if_else(Sector == \"Energy\", \"Energy\", \"Other Technology\"))\n\n# Create the line plot\nggplot(vis_data, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Investment, color = SectorType, group = SectorType)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~Post2020, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Investment Trends by Sector Over Time\",\n       subtitle = \"Comparison of total investments in Energy vs Technology sectors\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Total Investment (Millions)\",\n       color = \"Sector Type\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Energy\" = \"red\", \"Other Technology\" = \"blue\"))\n```\n\n**Figure 3**: **Comparative Analysis of Chinese Investment in Latin\nAmerican Energy Sectors V Technology Sector Pre and Post-2020**\n\nThe graph vividly illustrates the investment trends in the Energy and Technology sectors in Latin America, highlighting the differential impact of China's policy focus on sustainable technologies post-2020. Before 2020, investments in both sectors show fluctuations, with Energy occasionally outpacing Technology. However, post-2020, there is a pronounced surge in investments within the Energy sector, aligning with China's intensified emphasis on green technologies. This contrast is stark against the relatively stable investment patterns observed in the Technology sector, which, while significant, do not exhibit a comparable increase.\n\nThis visual representation supports the hypothesis that the shift in Chinese investment towards renewable energies is not merely a function of broader technological advancements but is significantly driven by deliberate policy initiatives aimed at sustainable development. The distinction in investment trends post-2020 substantiates the idea that policy changes have a direct and robust impact on the Energy sector, thereby validating the effectiveness of policy-driven shifts towards sustainable investment practices, as opposed to general technological growth observed in the Technology sector.\n\n## **Discussion and Policy Implications**\n\nThe research project investigating the effects of China's focus on sustainable development on investment patterns in Latin America provides nuanced insights but leaves some questions unanswered due to statistical limitations. The findings from the main regression model suggest an increase in investments post-2020, particularly within the energy sector, which aligns with China's green initiatives under the Belt and Road Initiative. However, the relatively modest size of the interaction term between post-2020 years and the energy sector, combined with its large standard error, indicates that while investments have increased, the effect is not as strong or as directly attributable to policy changes as hypothesized.\n\nThe empirical extension, contrasting the energy and technology sectors, provides additional context. It suggests that the increase in energy sector investments post-2020 might not be exclusively due to green policies but could also be influenced by overarching technological advancements that also impact the technology sector. The large standard errors here further suggest high variability and potential confounding factors affecting the investment data.\n\nThese findings underscore the complexities of attributing investment trends to specific policy initiatives in the dynamic context of global finance and economic development. Although there is evidence suggesting a policy impact, the conclusive power of these results is limited by statistical significance issues, suggesting the need for more robust data or alternative research methodologies that might include longer time spans or detailed sector-specific analyses.\n\n#### **Policy Implications**\n\nReinforcement of Green Policies: The data supports the continuation and possibly the intensification of policies aimed at encouraging sustainable development investments. Policymakers could consider enhancing incentives for foreign investments in the renewable energy sector in Latin America.\n\nBroader Policy Scope: Given the intertwined effects of technological advancements and policy initiatives, policies should also address the broader infrastructure and innovation ecosystem to fully leverage technological growth alongside green investments.\n\nData and Research Investment: To better understand and harness these trends, investing in comprehensive data collection and more granular research could be crucial. This would help isolate the effects of specific policies and understand the broader economic impacts.\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Engaging local stakeholders in Latin America to tailor policies that address both regional ambitions and the strategic goals of investors like China could enhance the effectiveness of these investments.\n\nFuture Research: Future studies should explore the causal pathways in greater depth, perhaps by employing methodologies like instrumental variables that can handle endogeneity more robustly. Additionally, case studies or qualitative analyses might provide insights into the micro-mechanisms through which policies affect sector-specific investments.\n\nIn conclusion, while the results provide some support for the hypothesis that China’s green policies have positively influenced investments in renewable energy in Latin America, the evidence is not robust enough to definitively state that policy changes alone drove these trends. Further research and more detailed data are required to clarify these dynamics and to guide policy formulation and investment strategies effectively.\n\n## **References**\n\n:::
